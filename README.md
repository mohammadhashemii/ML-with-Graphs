Solutions for Stanford CS224W (Machine Learning with Graphs) Colabs and Assignments, Fall 2021.

http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/index.html

## Colab 0 (No code needed)

- Getting familiar with NetworkX and PyTorch Geometric (PyG)
- Network visualization
- Working with a KarateClub as a common dataset in `torch_geometric.datasets`
- Implementing a simple Graph Neural Network (GNN)

## Colab 1

- Extract necessary information of graphs using NetworkX functionalities
- Create and manipulate node embeddings using `nn.Embedding` module in PyTorch
- Learn node embeddings on Karate dataset

## Colab 2

- Build the first Graph Neural Netwrok and train it from scratch for both node-level and graph-level classification.
